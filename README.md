# AnTipMarker

This set of MATLAB scripts requires:
1) an AVI format video of the ant behavior (recommended resolution 0.22 mm/px, 30 fps).
2) a background image (.tiff) saved in the same folder that shows the trail without the ant. If you donâ€™t have this, one will be created from the maximum intensity projection, but it may not work as well.
